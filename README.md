Tclsgg is a static site generator with template support written in Tcl for danyilbohdan.com. It is intended to make it easy to manage a small to medium-sized personal website with an optional blog, "small" meaning one with under about 2000 pages. Tclssg uses Markdown for content formatting, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for layout (with Bootstrap theme support) and Tcl code embedded in HTML for templating.

**Warning! Tclssg is still in early development and may change rapidly in incompatible ways.**

**As of December 2014 at least one major change that breaks existing template code should be expected before the codebase stabilizes.**

Features
--------

* [Markdown](#markup), Bootstrap themes, Tcl code for [templates](#templating);
* Distinguishes between plain old pages and blog posts [1];
* Generates only relative links;
* Output is valid HTML5 and CSS level 3;
* Deploy over FTP with a single built-in command;
* Deploy over SCP or other protocols with a [custom deployment command](#using-deploycustomcommand);
* Supports external comment engines (currently: Disqus);
* [Reasonably fast](https://github.com/dbohdan/tclssg/wiki/Performance);
* Few dependencies.

1\. A blog post differs from a plain old page in that it has a sidebar with links to other blog posts sorted by recency and tags. The latest blog posts are featured on the blog index and tag pages are generated to collect blog posts with the same tag.

Getting started
---------------

Tclssg is known to run on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OS X and Windows XP/7/8.x.

To use it you will need Tcl 8.5 or newer, Tcllib and SQLite version 3 bindings for Tcl installed.

To install Tcl and Tcllib on **Debian/Ubuntu** run the following command:

    sudo apt-get install tcl tcllib libsqlite3-tcl

On **Fedora/RHEL/CentOS**:

    su -
    yum install tcl tcllib sqlite-tcl

On **Windows** the easiest option is to install ActiveTcl from [ActiveState](http://activestate.com/). The copy of Tcl that comes with [Git for Windows](http://msysgit.github.io/) does not include Tcllib or an SQLite version 3 module, so it will not run Tclssg out of the box.

Once you have the requirements installed clone this repository, `cd` into it then run

    chmod +x ssg.tcl
    ./ssg.tcl init
    ./ssg.tcl build
    ./ssg.tcl open

or on Windows

    ssg.cmd init
    ssg.cmd build
    ssg.cmd open

This will create a new website project in the directory `website/input`, build the website in `website/output` and open the result in the default web browser.

Glossary
--------

| Term | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Page | The main building block of your static website. A page is a file with the extension `.md` and Markdown content based on which HTML output is produced. When a page from the input directory is processed by Tclssg an HTML file is placed under the same relative path in the output directory with the same file name. For example, placing the page `test/page1.md` in `inputDir`  will generate the HTML file `test/page1.html` in `outputDir`. A page can be a blog post (see below) or not. |
| Blog post | Blog posts are pages with special features enabled that help navigate a typical blog: tags for categorization and a sidebar with links to other blog posts. Blog posts are presented in a chronological order  (based on their the `date` variables) on the blog index page. The order in which the links to blog posts appear on the sidebar is also determined by the posts' dates. The sidebar, tags and other features can be selectively disabled for an individual blog post. |
| Index | The home/landing page of your website. Typically `index.md`. |
| Blog index | The blog index is a page or a set of pages that present all of your blog posts in the order from the latest to the oldest. The website setting `blogIndex` (normally typically set to `blog/index.md`) determines what page is used as the basis for the blog index. To avoid producing overly long webpages and HTML files that are too large the blog index page will be broken into separate HTML files according the website setting `blogPostsPerFile` (see section ["Website settings"](#website-settings)). |
| Tag page | A tag page is a page that shows all blog posts that have a certain tag in a chronological order. When you build your static website a tag page is created for each tag. Like the blog index a tag page will be broken into separate HTML files according the website setting `blogPostsPerFile`. The website setting `tagPage` (normally set to `blog/tag.md`) determines what page is used as the basis for tag pages. If you have a tag `space` then the content of `blog/tag.md` will be copied to `blog/tag-space.md`  |
| Template | A file with Tcl code embedded in HTML markup. Once a page has been converted from Markdown to HTML its content is rendered according to the template's logic (code), which interprets the settings specified in the page file and the website config file. Tclssg's templating works in two stages: first, input pages are processed into [HTML5 articles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) (delimited by the tags `<article>...</article>`) using the article template (`article.thtml` by default) then one or several articles are inserted into the document template (`bootstrap.thtml`), one for normal pages and blog posts and several for the blog index. |
| Configuration file | The file `website.conf` in the input directory that specifies the settings (variables) that apply to the static website as a whole like the website title. |
| Variable | In Tclssg a variable specifies one setting for either the whole website or an individual page. Those range from the page title, which you'd normally want to set for each page, to the password for the FTP server your want to deploy your website to. When a variable is set in a page file it specifies the corresponding setting for just that individual page. When a variable is set the configuration ("config") file it specifies a setting for the website as a whole. |
| Static file | A file that should be copied verbatim into to the output directory. Those are stored in a subdirectory of the input directory (`inputDir/static`). File paths relative to `inputDir/static` are preserved, which means that, e.g., `website/input/static/blah/file.zip` will be copied to `website/output/blah/file.zip`.  |
| Project skeleton | A starting point for Tclssg websites contained in the `skeleton` directory. |
| Output | The static website ready to be deployed. Consists of HTML files created by Tclssg based on the content in the input directory plus the static files. It is placed in the output directory `outputDir`. |

Usage
-----

    usage: ./ssg.tcl <command> [options] [inputDir [outputDir]]

`inputDir` specifies the directory where the input for Tclssg is located. It defaults to `website/input` in the current directory.
`outputDir` is where the static website's files are placed when the output is generated. When neither `inputDir` nor `outputDir` is supplied on the command line `outputDir` defaults to `website/output`; if `inputDir` is supplied but not `outputDir` then Tclssg will use the value of the variable `outputDir` in the configuration file `inputDir/website.conf`.

Possible commands are

* `init [--templates]` — сreate a new website project from the default project skeleton.

> The option `--templates` will make `init` copy the template files from the project skeleton into a subdirectory named `templates` in `inputDir`. You should only use it if you intend to customize your page's layout (HTML code); it is not necessary if you only intend to customize the websites' look using CSS (including Bootstrap themes).

>By default your project will directly use the page template of the project skeleton. Not keeping a separate copy of the template is a good idea because it means you won't have to update it manually when a new version of Tclssg introduces changes to templating (which at this point in development it may).

* `build` — build a static website in `outputDir` based on the data in `inputDir`.
* `clean` — delete all files in `outputDir`.
* `update [--templates] [--yes]` — replace static files in `inputDir` that have matching ones in the project skeleton with those in the project skeleton. Do the same with templates if the option `--templates` is given. Tclssg will prompt you whether to replace each file unless you specify the option `--yes`. This is used to update your website project when Tclssg itself is updated.
* `deploy-copy` — copy files to the destination set in the configuration file (`website.conf`). This can be used if your build machine is your web server or if you have the server's documents directory mounted as a local path.
* `deploy-custom` — execute a custom deploy command.
* `deploy-ftp` — deploy files to the FTP server according to the FTP settings in the configuration file.
* `open` — open the index page in the default browser.

The default layout of the input directory is as follows:

    .
    ├── pages <-- Markdown files from which HTML is generated.
    │   ├── blog <-- Blog posts.
    │   │   └── index.md <-- Blog index page with the tag list and blog posts
    │   │                    in a chronological order.
    │   └── index.md <-- Website index page.
    ├── static <-- Files copied verbatim to the output directory.
    │   └── images <-- The default location for image files.
    ├── templates <-- The website's layout templates (HTML + Tcl).
    │   ├── article.thtml
    │   └── bootstrap.thtml
    └── website.conf <-- The configuration file.

Once you've initialized your website project with `init` you can customize it by specifying general and per-page settings. Specify its general settings by setting variables in `website.conf` and the per-page settings by setting variables in the individual page files. Those are two different sets of variables but defaults for page variables can be set in `website.conf` (look for `pageVariables` below).

Markup
------

Write [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and use `<!-- more -->` to designate the break between the teaser (the part of the article shown on the blog index and on tag pages) and the rest of the content. Use page variables to customize page settings. Example:

```markdown
{
    title {Test page}
    blogPost 1
    tags {test {a long tag with spaces}}
    date 2014-01-02
    hideDate 1
}
**Lorem ipsum** reprehenderit _ullamco deserunt sit eiusmod_ ut minim in id
voluptate proident enim eu aliqua sit.

<!-- more -->

Mollit ex cillum pariatur anim [exemplum](http://example.com) tempor
exercitation sed eu Excepteur dolore deserunt cupidatat aliquip irure in
fugiat eu laborum est.
```

Templating
----------

Templating involves including one of the following constructs in your markup. You can use templates in HTML in templates or in Markdown in page files when `expandMacrosInPages` is enabled.

### 1. `<% raw code %>`

Wraps code around content. This is typically used for loops.

#### Examples
##### In template files (HTML)

    <ul>
    <% foreach city $cities { %>
        <li><%= $city %></li>
    <% } %>
    </ul>

##### In a page file (Markdown)

Using this requires setting `expandMacrosInPages` to `1` in `website.conf`.

    <% foreach city $cities { %>
    * <%= $city %>
    <% } %>

### 2. `<%= expression>`

Inserts the value of an expression (including an expression consisting of just a single variable like `$city`) in the output.

#### Examples

* `<%= $content %>`

* `<%= 1 + 2 %>`

### 3. `<%! command %>`.

Inserts the return value of a single command in the output.

#### Examples

* `<title><%! format-html-title %></title>`

### Page template example: responsive images with Bootstrap

This subsection describes template commands included with Tclssg that are intended for use in page files. They solve the problem of responsive images being awkward to include in Markdown and show how page template commands can be useful.

The problem is as follows: Bootstrap allows you to make images responsive (automatically and proportionally scaled to the width of your page) and centered (if they are not wide enough to fill the entire page width) by giving them appropriate classes through the `class` attribute, however, Markdown doesn't allow you to specify the `class` attribute of an image. You could do it manually with HTML markup like

    <img src="../images/picture.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Alt text">

but with many images it introduces unnecessary repetition and you have to put in the image path manually. The following macros allow you to include responsive images in a page with a concise command.

To use this feature first set `expandMacrosInPages` to `1` and put `<% interp-source img-procs.tcl %>` after the frontmatter in the file where you intend to use responsive images:

    {
        title {Hello!}
    }
    <% interp-source img-procs.tcl %>

Now you can use the command

    <%! local-image picture.png "Alt text" %>`

to include an image from `inputDir/static/images` (`inputDir/static/images/picture.png` in this case). This command generates the same HTML markup as seen above.

You can also use

    <%! image http://example.com/image.png "Alt text" %>

to make images sourced from anywhere responsive.

Page settings
------------------
Page settings are specified using page variables. Each page variable alters a setting for just the page it is set on. Page variables are set at in the front matter (immediately at the top of a page source file) using Tcl dict syntax. Example:

    {
        variableNameOne short_value
        variableNameTwo {A variable value with spaces.}
    }
    Lorem ipsum... (The rest of the page content follows.)

Values can be quoted with braces (`{value}`) or double quotes (`"value"`). If you want to set a page variable for more than one page at once look at the website setting `pageVariables` in the next section.

The following variables have an effect for any page they are set on:

| Variable name | Example value(s) | Description |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| title | `{Some title}` | The title of the individual page. By default it goes in the `<title>` tag and the article header at the top of the page. It is also used as the text for sidebar links to the page. |
| hideTitle | 0/1 | Do not put `title` in the `<title>` tag and do not display it at the top of the page. The page title will then only be used for sidebar links to the page. |
| blogPost | 0/1 | If this is set to 1 the page will be a blog post. It will show in the blog post list. |
| date | `2014`, `2014/06/23`, `2014-06-23`, `2014-06-23 14:35`, `2014-06-23 14:35:01` | Blog posts are sorted on the `date` field. The date must be in an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)-like format of year-month-day-hour-minute-second. Dashes, spaces, colons, slashes, dots and `T` are all treated the same for sorting, so `2014-06-23T14:35:01` is equivalent to `2014 06 23 14 35 01`. |
| hideDate | 0/1 | Do not put show the page date. |
| author | `McPerson` | The name of the author or the person responsible for the page. Will be displayed under the title. |
| hideAuthor | 0/1 | Do not put show the page author. |
| headExtra | `{<link rel="stylesheet" href="./page-specific.css">}` | Line to append to `<head>`. |
| hideFooter | 0/1 | Disable the "Powered by" footer. The copyright notice, if enabled, is still displayed. |
| showUserComments | 0/1 | Enable comments using the comment engine specified in `commentsEngine`. |
| navbarItems | `{ Home $indexLink Blog $blogIndexLink Contact {$rootDirPath/contact.html}`  |  The list of items to display in the navbar at the top of the page. The format of the list is `{LinkText LinkHref LinkText LinkHref...}` where LinkHref is treated links an expression inside the template. |

These variables only affect blog posts:

| Variable name | Example value(s) | Description |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| hideFromSidebar | 0/1 | Unlists the post from other posts' sidebar. |
| hideSidebarLinks | 0/1 | Don't show links to other blog posts in the sidebar on the present page. |
| hideSidebarNote | 0/1 | Don't show the sidebar note on the present page. |
| hidePostTags | 0/1 | Don't show whatever tags the present blog post has. |
| hideTagCloud | 0/1 | Don't show the list of all tags with links to the appropriate tag pages. |
| hideFromCollections | 0/1 | Do no include the content of this post in article collections like the tag pages and the blog index. |
| tags | `{tag1 tag2 {tag three with multiple words} {tag four} tag-five}` | Blog post tags for categorization. Each tag will link to its respective tag page. |
| moreText | `{(<a href="%s">read on</a>)}` | What appears at the end of the teaser (the content before `<!-- more -->`) on the blog index page; `%s` in `moreText` is replaced with a link to the full blog post. It is set to `(...)` (without a link to the page) by default. |
| sidebarNote | `{<h3>About</h3> This is my blog.}` | The text of the sidebar note in HTML. The note is displayed about the sidebar links and the tag cloud. |

All 0/1 settings default to `0`.

Website settings
----------------

The following settings are specified in the file `website.conf` in `inputDir` and affect all pages. The format of `website.conf` is as follows:

    variableNameOne short_value
    variableNameTwo {A variable value with spaces.}

Values can be quoted with braces (`{value}`) or double quotes (`"value"`).

| Variable name | Example value(s) | Description |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| websiteTitle | `{My Awesome Website}` | The text that is displayed in the navbar at the top of every page (Bootstrap's `navbar-brand`) as well as appended to the `<title>` tag of every page's HTML output. For this example value the `<title>` tag of a page will say "Hello! &#124; My Awesome Website" if its `title` is `{Hello!}` .  |
| outputDir | `../output`, `/var/www/` | The destination directory under which HTML output is produced if no `outputDir` is given in the command line arguments. Relative paths are interpreted as relative to `inputDir`, so, for example, if `outputDir` is set to `../output` and you run Tclssg with the command line arguments `build myproject/input` the effective output directory will be `myproject/output`. |
| articleTemplateFileName | `article.thtml` | Sets the file name of the desired article template file, which determines what goes between the `<article>...</article>` tags for each page. If no value for this variable is specified then the value `article.thtml` is used. Tclssg looks for the article template file in `inputDir/templates` first then in the `templates` subdirectory of the project skeleton.  |
| documentTemplateFileName | `article.thtml` | Sets the file name of the desired document template file, which determines the HTML document structure of the output (expect for what goes between the `<article>...</article>` tags). If no value for this variable is specified then the value `bootstrap.thtml` is used. Tclssg looks for the page template file in `inputDir/templates` first then in the `templates` subdirectory of the project skeleton. |
| deployCopyPath | `{/var/www/}` | The location to copy the output to when the command `deploy-copy` is run. |
| deployCustomCommand | | See [the corresponding section](#using-deploycustomcommand) below. |
| deployFtpServer | `{ftp.hosting.example.net}` | The server to deploy the static website to when the command `deploy-ftp` is run. |
| deployFtpPort | `21` | FTP server port. |
| deployFtpPath | `{htdocs}` | The directory on the FTP server where to deploy the static website. |
| deployFtpUser | `{user}` | FTP user name. |
| deployFtpPassword | `{password}` | FTP password. Not shown in Tclssg's logs. |
| expandMacrosInPages | 0/1 | Whether template macros are allowed in pages. If set to `0` macro code in a page will be treated as Markdown text just like the rest of the page. |
| charset | `utf-8` | The pages' character set. |
| indexPage | `{index.md}` | The index page. |
| blogIndexPage | `{blog/index.md}` | The page that will contain your blog posts in a chronological order. If your blog index is `blog/index.md` the processed content of `blog/index.md` is prepended to each HTML page of the output and its variables will be used for the page settings. |
| blogPostsPerFile | 10 | The maximum number of the blog posts that can be placed in one HTML file of the blog index. |
| tagPage | `{blog/tag.md}` | The page to use as a basis when creating tag pages. If your `tagPage` is set to `blog/tag.md` the processed content of `blog/tag.md` is prepended to each HTML page of every tag page created and its variables will be used for the page settings. |
| sortTagsBy | `frequency`, `name` | Determines the order in which tags get displayed in the tag cloud. Currently there are two possible settings: `frequency` (most often used tags first) and `name` (default; sort tags alphabetically by the name of the tag itself). |
| pageVariables | `{ hideSidebar 1 title {Untitled page} }` | The default values for page variables. If a page doesn't set a page variable Tclssg will look for that variable's value in `pageVariables` before falling back on a built-in default. If it does set some variable then its value overrides the one in `pageVariables`. |
| copyright | `{Copyright (C) 2014 You}` | A copyright line to display in the footer. |
| commentsEngine | `none`/`disqus` | Selects what comment engine (external software or service for blog comments) to use on pages that set `showUserComments` to `1`. |
| commentsDisqusShortname | `example` | Configuration for when `commentsEngine` is set to `disqus`. Specifies your [shortname](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208-what-s-a-shortname-), which identifies you to the service. |

Like page settings all 0/1 website settings default to `0`.

### Using `deployCustomCommand`

The setting `deployCustomCommand` allows you to define complex deployment scenarios using shell commands (on *nix) or `cmd.exe` commands (on Windows). The value of `deployCustomCommand` consists of three keys, `start`, `file` and `end`, followed by their respective values. The command under the key `file` is run for every file in `outputDir` while `start` and `end` are run once at the beginning and the end of the deployment operation respectively. Here's an example of a `website.conf` that does SCP deployment on `./ssg.tcl deploy-custom`:

    [...]
    deployCustomCommand {
        start {scp -rp "$outputDir" host.example.net:/var/www/}
        file {}
        end {}
    }
    [...]

In the above example `$outputDir` is replaced with the actual output directory path when the command is run. In the commands for `start`, `file` and `end` the following variables are recognized and substituted: `$outputDir` (the output directory), `$file` (file path), `$fileRel` (file path relative to `outputDir`). This means that if you put `file {echo "$fileRel"}` in `deployCustomCommand` and run Tclssg with the command `./ssg.tcl deploy-custom ./website/input ./website/output` it will print the relative paths of all files in `./website/output`.
