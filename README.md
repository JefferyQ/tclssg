Tclssg
=======

A static site generator with template support written in Tcl for danyilbohdan.com. Intended to make it easy to manage a small personal website with an optional blog.

Features
--------

* Mark up content with Markdown.
* Produce plain old pages or blogs post. [1]
* Tag blog posts. Put a tag cloud on your blog index.
* Upload the resulting website over FTP with a single command.
* Embed Tcl code in HTML for templating. [2]
* Generated links are all relative.
* Output is valid HTML5 and CSS level 3.

1\. Blog posts differ from plain old pages in that they have a sidebar of links to other blog posts sorted by recency and tags.

2\. Templating example:

        <article>
        <% textutil::indent $content {        } %>
        </article>

Getting started
---------------

To use Tclssg you will need Tcl 8.5 or newer and Tcllib installed. You will also need a Markdown processor to turn Markdown into HTML. The default processor Markdown shipped with Tclssg is [Markdown 1.0.1](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which requires Perl 5.

Installing Tcl + Tcllib on Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install tcl tcllib

On Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:

    su -
    yum install tcl tcllib

Once you have the requirements installed clone this repository, `cd` into it then run

    ./ssg.tcl init
    ./ssg.tcl build
    ./ssg.tcl open

This will create a new website project in the directory `website/input`, build it in `website/output` and open the result in the browser. If you're not on Linux instead of running `./ssg.tcl open` open `website/output/index.html` manually.

Usage
-----

    usage: ./ssg.tcl <command> [sourceDir [destDir]]

`sourceDir` specifies the directory where the input for Tclssg is located. It defaults to `website/input` in the current directory.
`destDir` is where the HTML is put. It defaults to `website/output` and can also be set in the configuration file in `sourceDir`.

Possible commands are

* `init` — сreate new project from the default project skeleton (a starting point for Tclssg websites contained in the `skeleton` directory).

> **NOTE:** `init` copies the template files into a subdirectory named `templates` in `sourceDir` so that you may customize them. If you are fine with having the default page layout for the HTML output delete `$sourceDir/templates` to use the template from the project skeleton. E.g., run

> `    ./ssg.tcl init`

> `    rm -r ./website/templates`

> This will eliminate the need to update your project's template when Tclssg is updated.

* `build` — build a static website in `destDir` based on the data in `sourceDir`.
* `clean` — delete all files in `destDir`.
* `update` — replace static files and templates in `sourceDir` that have matching ones in the project skeleton with those in the project skeleton. This is used to update your website project when Tclssg itself is updated. Tclssg will prompt you whether to replace each file.
* `upload-copy` — copy files to the destination set in the configuration file (`website.conf`).

> **NOTE:** This can be used, e.g., if your build machine is your web server or if you have the server's documents directory mounted as a local path.

* `upload-ftp` — upload files to FTP server set in the configuration file.
* `open` — open index page in the default browser.

The default layout of the source directory is

    .
    ├── pages <-- Markdown files from which HTML is generated.
    │   ├── blog <-- Blog posts.
    │   │   └── index.md <-- Blog index page with tag list
    │   │                    and links to blog posts.
    │   ├── index.md <-- Website index page.
    ├── static <-- Files copied verbatim to the output
    │   │          directory.
    │   └── main.css
    ├── templates
    │   └── default.thtml <-- The website's layout
    │                         template (HTML + Tcl).
    └── website.conf <-- Configurating file.

Once you've initialized your website with `init` you customize it with general and per-page setting. Edit its general settings in `website.conf` and the per-page settings in the individual page files.

Website settings
----------------

The following settings are specified in the file `website.conf` in `sourceDir` and affect all pages. The format of `website.conf` is as follows:

    variableNameOne short_value
    variableNameTwo {A variable value with spaces.}

| Variable name | Example value(s) | Description |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| websiteTitle | `{My Awesome Website}` | Appened to the `<title>` of every page. E.g., in this example if `pageTitle` of a page is `{Hello!}` the `<title>` tag will say `Hello! | My Awesome Website`.  |
| url | `{http://example.com/}` | Currently not used. |
| destDir | `../output`, `/var/www/` | The default destination directory under which HTML output is produced. Relative paths are taken as relative to `sourceDir` (as given on the command line). |
| uploadCopyPath | `{/var/www/}` | The location to copy the built static website to on command `upload-copy`. |
| uploadFtpServer | `{ftp.hosting.example.net}` | The server to upload the built static website to on command `upload-ftp`. |
| uploadFtpPort | `21` | FTP port. |
| uploadFtpPath | `{htdocs}` | The directory on the FTP server where to upload the static website. |
| uploadFtpUser | `{user}` | FTP user name. |
| uploadFtpPassword | `{password}` | FTP password. |
| expandMacrosInPages | 0/1 | Whether template macros in the format of `<% tclcommand args %>` are allowed in pages. |
| charset | `utf-8` | Page character set. |
| indexPage | `{index.md}` | The page all other pages will have a link back to. |
| tagsPage | `{blog/index.md}` | The page that tags link to. Enable `showTagCloud` on it. |
| copyright | `{Copyright (C) 2014 You}` | A copyright line to display in the footer. |

All 0/1 settings default to `0`.

Per-page variables
------------------
Per-page variables alter setting for just the page they are set on. They are set in the page source file (e.g., {index.md}), each one on a separate line that start with `!` (exclamation mark) and has the form of `! variableName {Value}`. Those lines are normally placed at the top of the page source file. Example usage:

    ! variableNameOne short_value
    ! variableNameTwo {A variable value with spaces.}
    Lorem ipsum... (The rest of the page content follows.)

| Variable name | Example value(s) | Description |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| pageTitle | `{Some title}` | Title of the individual page. By default it goes in the `<title>` tag and the article header at the top of the page. It is also used as the text for sidebar/tag cloud links to the page. |
| hideTitle | 0/1 | Do not put `pageTitle` in the `<title>` tag and do not display it at the top of the page. The page title will then only be used for sidebar/tag cloud links to the page. |
| blogEntry | 0/1 | If this is set to 1 the page will show in the blog post list. |
| hideFromSidebar | 0/1 | Unlists the page the sidebar. |
| hideSidebar | 0/1 | Hide the sidebar *on the page.* |
| hidePostTags | 0/1 | Hide whatever tags a blog has. |
| hideFooter | 0/1 | Disable the "Powered by" footer. |
| showTagCloud | 0/1 | Show the list of all tags and links to those blog posts that have each. Presently does not actually look like a cloud. |
| date | `2014`, `2014/06/23`, `2014-06-23`, `2014-06-23 14:35`, `2014-06-23 14:35:01` | . Blog posts are sorted on the `date` field. The date must be in a [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)-like format of year-month-day-hour-minute. Dashes, spaces, colons, slashes, dots and `T` are all treated the same for sorting, so `2014-06-23T14:35:01` is equivalent to `2014 06 23 14 35 01`. |
| tags | `{tag1 tag2 {tag three with multiple words} {tag four} tag-five}` | Blog post tags for categorization. Each tag will link to the page `tagPage`. |
| headExtra | `{<link rel="stylesheet" href="./page-specific.css">}` | Line to append to `<head>`. |

Like with website settings all 0/1 settings default to `0`.

For multiline page variable values and manipulating website variables just for the current page set `expandMacrosInPages` to `1` and use a macro in the page like

    <%
    dict set pages $currentPageId variables headExtra {
        <link rel="stylesheet"
        href="./contact.css">
    }
    set websiteTitle blah
    lindex ""
    %>
